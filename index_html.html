      <p class="scripture">“Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.” – Proverbs 22:6 (NIV)</p>
      <p>
        At <strong>Foundations at Home Education Consulting</strong>, I help families design learning environments that support the whole child –
        academically, emotionally, and spiritually. Whether you're just starting homeschooling or navigating learning challenges,
        you don't have to walk that journey alone.

      <h2>About Jenny</h2>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Jenny Henderson</strong>, a retired special education teacher and reading coach with a heart for children and families.
        After decades in the classroom, I now partner with homeschool parents who want structure, peace, and confidence as they teach at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in working with diverse learners, including children with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and other learning differences,
        as well as students who simply need a different approach than traditional school.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to create a safe, encouraging space where parents feel supported and children are seen for their strengths.
